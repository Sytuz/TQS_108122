![Coverage](screenshots/Coverage.png)

There are a total of 7 uncovered lines, and 111 uncovered conditions (although only 8 appear in the sidebar).

While the coverage, being above 80%, is good, there are still some parts of the code that are not being tested. More specifically, there are a lot of conditions that are not being tested, which could lead to bugs in the future.
